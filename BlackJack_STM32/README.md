This code was written for an STM32F401RET6 microcontroller. It utilizes an external test circuit and GPIO pins to capture user input for a standard blackjack game, with player and house card values stored in memory registers. Card value and assignments were randomly generated using a linear congruential generator and an initial 64-bit seed. The game was ran and debugged through Keil uVision 5, display was handled by a connected LCD screen.
